This is heavily based on work by [Jason Coon](http://evilgeniuslabs.org/) found [here](https://github.com/jasoncoon/fibonacci) and the great work of the [FastLED team](http://fastled.io/).

Idea of a Fibonacci display and the incremental drift algorithm by [Jim Bumgardner](http://jbum.com/).

[noise-noise](https://gist.github.com/StefanPetrick/c856b6d681ec3122e5551403aabfcc68) algorithm by [Stefan Petrick](https://gist.github.com/StefanPetrick).

Use fibonacci.pde to generate a PDF as a template for your LED layout. Sample is included here.
